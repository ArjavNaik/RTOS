# RTOS
This repository consists of my RTOS projects which are done using STM32 Nucleo Development Board (with STM32F446RE MCU Nucleo-F446RE.)

Devlopment Board used STM32 Nucleo Development Board (with STM32F446RE MCU Nucleo-F446RE.)

This is the way I learned about FreeRTOS during by course on Udemy(Mastering RTOS: Hands on FreeRTOS and STM32Fx with Debugging).

These projects were done using system workbench based on Eclipse.
I have also used Segger System View to learn more abount the FreeRTOS scheduling. This I did while analysing the plots from Segger system View.
(For communication USART was used)
Note:
To find the main.c for each project Path will be :  projectname/src/main.c For eg: RTOS/workspace/STM32_FreeRTOS_IdleHook/src/main.c
